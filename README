DESCRIPTION
-----------

I was looking for a way to automatically include and define the Git hash of a project before compiling.
So I started typing and after a night of learning C this came out of it.

OVERVIEW
--------

samp-git-hash includes:

git-hash:
	The binary that generates the include for Pawn.
	
DEPENDENCIES
------------

This project has dependencies, make sure that you meet them.
	Git 1.7.9.3
	
BINARIES
--------

There are compiled binaries available for Windows operating systems.
It is very easy to compile this for Linux, but there is no official SA:MP Pawn compiler for Linux.

INSTALLATION
------------

Compile:
	git-hash.c
		Using GCC: gcc git-hash.c -o git-hash
		Using Makefile: make

SUPPORT
-------

Create an issue at <https://github.com/Jeroen52/samp-git-hash> if you need any help, or post it in the official SA:MP thread at <http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?p=3644399#post3644399>.
