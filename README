DESCRIPTION
-----------

I was looking for a way to automatically include and define the Git hash of a project before compiling.
So I started typing and after a night of learning C this came out of it.

OVERVIEW
--------

samp-git-hash includes:

git-hash:
	The binary that generates the include for Pawn.
	
DEPENDENCIES
------------

This project has dependencies, make sure that you meet them.
	Git 1.7.9.3
	
BINARIES
--------

There are compiled binaries available for Windows operating systems.
It is very easy to compile this for Linux, but there is no official SA:MP Pawn compiler for Linux.

INSTALLATION
------------

Compile:
	git-hash.c
		Using GCC: gcc git-hash.c -o git-hash
		Using Makefile: make
		
Alternative:
	It is possible to install the program on CentOS 6 and 7 using the RPM packages below or after configuring YUM with the repository below. The program can be accessed after installing using 'samp-git-hash'.

RPM package
-----------

There are RPM packages available, these have been built on CentOS 6 and 7.

YUM repository
--------------

To install 'samp-git-hash', you need to configure YUM with my repository, to add my YUM repository you need to use the following Shell script: 'curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jeroendeneef.repo https://rpm.jeroendeneef.com/jeroendeneef/CentOS/jeroendeneef.repo'.
This program is available in the repository under 'samp-git-hash'.
